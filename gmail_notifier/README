To-do
-----
0. IMPORTANT: Sometimes the python script goes haywire, taking up 100% CPU. Fix it.
1. Create a Makefile for easy installation of the application and all its dependencies.
2. Currently the username and password are hard-coded into the script. This vulnerability should be eliminated either by storing the password in encrypted form or storing it as plain text under the control of another password (say, the user's login password).
3. Currently, to check for new unread email, the script checks if the count of unread email has increased. This is not necessarily true (e.g. if the user reads an unread email and another new email arrives in the time between two checks).
4. Provide GUI for configuration options (time between 2 consecutive checks, expiry time of notifications, what things to display in the notification, etc).
5. Add support for other email clients (Yahoo!, Hotmail, etc).
